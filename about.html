                    <h1>What is this about?</h1>
                    <p>This came about months ago after a small argument with a friend; an argument that started because I didn’t understand what point they were making. But it wasn’t just that I didn’t understand, it’s that I wasn’t listening to them when they were talking to me.  “How rude,” you’re probably thinking, I know. Very rude it is. I noticed it wasn’t just myself who did this. Many people do this, when we’re distracted we don’t pay attention as well to what someone else is saying.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                    It got me thinking about my interactions with people, and in turn, how we listen. I really started focusing on my interactions, specifically, with friends and acquaintances. In this time, our time, of computers and phones and constant interaction, it is very easy for us—especially when we’re talking with others—to engage in multiple activities. More often than not, people will pick up their phone during conversation just to check the time, or that recent notification; maybe they’re waiting for an email, or an important phone call, by that point they’re already distracted, but by picking up the device they further that distraction, a lingering thought becomes a conscious thought. This interrupts the conscious listening and suddenly ‘that didn’t make sense’, ‘i’m confused’, ‘can you repeat that?’ starts to creep in to the conversation. </p>
